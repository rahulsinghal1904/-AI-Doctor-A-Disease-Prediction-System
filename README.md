# Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Here, we are using Machine Learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest and Naive Bayes for the purpose of predicting the disease from given symptoms. We take symptoms of the user as input and then predict the disease accordingly and then compare the accuracy generated from it.
